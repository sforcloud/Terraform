# Installing Terraform

1. To install Terraform, find the [appropriat package](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for your system and download it. Terraform is packaged as a zip archive.

2. After downloading Terraform, unzip the package. Terraform runs as a single binary named *terraform*. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Terraform will still function.

3. The final step is to make sure that the terraform binary is available on the PATH.
